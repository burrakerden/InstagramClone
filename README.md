# InstagramClone


A course was recommended to me by a friend, so I decided to enroll and dive into it. I followed the course diligently, completing each step until I reached the end. As someone who has gone through the entire course, I can confidently say that if you're looking to enhance your skills in Programmatic Layout, Firebase, Protocols, and Building a social network (post, like, comment, notification), this course is definitely worth considering.

The course details are provided below:
